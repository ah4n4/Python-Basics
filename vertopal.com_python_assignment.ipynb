    "> ***What is Python, and why is it popular?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Python is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its\n",
    "> readability, simplicity, and large library support. It is popular\n",
    "> because it is easy to learn, versatile, and widely used in data\n",
    "> science, web development, automation, and AI.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What is an interpreter in Python?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> An interpreter executes Python code line by line, translating it into\n",
    "> machine-readable instructions.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What are pre-defined keywords in Python?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Keywords are reserved words in Python that have special meaning (e.g.,\n",
    "> if, else, while, for). They cannot be used as variable names.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Can keywords be used as variable names?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> No, keywords cannot be used as variable names because they have\n",
    "> predefined meanings in Python.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What is mutability in Python?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Mutability refers to whether an object’s value can be changed after\n",
    "> creation. Mutable objects can be modified, while immutable ones\n",
    "> cannot.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Why are lists mutable, but tuples are immutable?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Lists are mutable because they allow modifications like adding,\n",
    "> removing, or changing elements. Tuples are immutable to ensure data\n",
    "> integrity and faster performance.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What is the difference between '==' and 'is' operators in\n",
    "> Python?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The '==' operator checks if values are equal, while 'is' checks if two\n",
    "> references point to the same object in memory.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What are logical operators in Python?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Logical operators are 'and', 'or', and 'not'. They are used to combine\n",
    "> conditional statements.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What is type casting in Python?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Type casting is converting one data type into another (e.g., string to\n",
    "> int).\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What is the difference between implicit and explicit type\n",
    "> casting?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Implicit casting is performed automatically by Python, while explicit\n",
    "> casting is done manually by the programmer using functions like int(),\n",
    "> float().\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What is the purpose of conditional statements in Python?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> Conditional statements are used to execute code only when a certain\n",
    "> condition is true.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***How does the elif statement work?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> The 'elif' statement checks multiple conditions. If the first\n",
    "> condition is false, it checks the next one, and so on.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***What is the difference between for and while loops?***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A 'for' loop is used when the number of iterations is known, while a\n",
    "> 'while' loop is used when the number of iterations depends on a\n",
    "> condition.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Describe a scenario where a while loop is more suitable than a for\n",
    "> loop.***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> A while loop is more suitable when you don’t know the number of\n",
    "> iterations beforehand, e.g., reading input until a user types 'exit'.\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Write a Python program to print 'Hello, World!'***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> print('Hello, World!')\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Write a Python program that displays your name and age.***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> name = 'Your Name'  \n",
    "> age = 25  \n",
    "> print(f'My name is {name} and I am {age} years old.')\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Write code to print all the pre-defined keywords in Python using\n",
    "> the keyword library.***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> import keyword  \n",
    "> print(keyword.kwlist)\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Write a program that checks if a given word is a Python keyword.***\n",
    ">\n",
    "> import keyword  \n",
    "> word = input('Enter a word: ')  \n",
    "> print(f'{word} is a keyword: {keyword.iskeyword(word)}')\n",
    ">\n",
    "> ***Create a list and tuple in Python, and demonstrate how attempting\n",
    "> to change an element works differently for each.***\n",
    ">\n",

    "> my_tuple = (1, 2, 3)  \n",
    "> my_list\\[0\\] = 10  \n",
    "> print('Modified list:', my_list)  \n",
